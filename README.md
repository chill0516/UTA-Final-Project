# UTA-Final-Project

Offensive, Defensive and Mitigation Strategies

# The objective was to practice a number of different concepts learned throughout the cybersecurity bootcamp course and to act as a pentester and SOC analyst. 

In this project, you will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working. 

If the alerts are working, you will then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, you will report back your findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.
